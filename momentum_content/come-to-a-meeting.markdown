At its core face-to-face encounters are central to the Momentum experience. We'd love to have you come out and see if Momentum is for you. 

Our monthly meeting is where much of the fun, growth and friendship happens! We make it worth getting out of bed on a Saturday morning.  Its the Second Saturday of every month at [Bramhall Park in San Jose](https://www.meetup.com/GoMomentum/). The meeting starts promptly at 8 AM, going till 10 AM, at which time we serve an amazing breakfast. Look for a group of about 50 men in the southwest corner of the park. You can just drop in, but we recommend you [e-mail]({{site.baseurl}}/contact/) ahead.

Social time over breakfast after the meeting will give you an additional opportunity to meet the members. All men are welcome and there is no charge to attend the meetings. New to Momentum? We will help you get acquainted. You will meet many of the members, learn our customs and principles, and have opportunities for growth and relationship.

Not into larger gatherings? Even more central to the Momentum experience are our small-group meetings, which you will also see listed at the above link or reach out and we'll connect you.

Feel free to [contact us here with any questions]({{site.baseurl}}/contact/).
